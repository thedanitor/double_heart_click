# Double Heart Click

https://thedanitor.github.io/double_heart_click/

This project is from the Day 29 code along video from Udemy's 50 projects in 50 days series focused on web development. I have added some comments to the CSS and JavaScript to make notes to myself why certain choices are being made and what particular lines of code do.

### Overall Impression

Cool project. Good reminder on how to target where mouse is clicked.

### Things Learned

* "dblclick" is an event listener type for double click.
